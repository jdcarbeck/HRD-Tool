# Running the project on your computer

1. Install Node
2. Install Dependencys
3. Run the project

## Installing Node

Node can be installed from the download page [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

For instalation on windows follow this [guide](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-node-js-npm-on-windows)

## Installing Project Dependencies

Navigate into the server directory in the mangement-portal folder.

Using `npm install` all the dependices in package-lock.json will be downloaded

## Running the project

Once the project dependencies are installed the project can be run either through `node index.js` or with `nodemon index.js`.

> nodemon allows for hot refreshs with new file saves but is the same as node

Look at Aritecture.md for more information about the server architecture.
